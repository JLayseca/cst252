	<h1> Lab #4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<main>
			<p> The aim of Lab #4 was to practice pseudocoding before converting said pseudocode into Javascript comments.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We had a bit of minor confusion about the pseduocode for task two. Initially we were writing it as a set of tasks we were writing
				them as instructions for the user rather than the steps the website should be taking. Past that, everything else was rather simple</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>	Task: Starting a Dungeons and Dragons campaign<br>
					1. Come up with a campaign idea<br>
						- Decide whether you’re running a pre-written module or a story and setting of your own creation.<br>
						- Decide if this game will be short or long? Is it a one-shot? Do you want to try running from level 1-20?<br>
						- If it is an original story, decide on the villains of your campaign.<br>
					2. Get some friends to be players in your game<br>
						- Think of a list of friends who you think might be interested in the campaign<br>
						- Reach out to said friends<br>
						- Sell them on your campaign idea<br>
					3. Decide where you are running the game<br>
						- If running the campaign online, select which websites you are using.<br>
						- If running the game in person choose whether you are running it at a player’s house or at your FLGS (“Friendly Local Game Store”)<br>
							+ If at Player’s house, choose which of your players is hosting it<br>
					4. Have a session 0<br>
						- Okay pre-created characters<br>
						- Help players who haven’t created a character do so if needed<br>
						- Have a discussion about what themes and events the players are okay with<br>
						- Pick a day that fits into everyone’s schedules<br>
					5. Play D&D and have fun!<br>
						- Decide who is bringing snacks<br>
						-	Make sure everyone has dice (if in person)<br>
