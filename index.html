					<ul><li><strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong></li></ul>
					<p>I'm a dungeon master. If we're being honest, I have waaaaaay too many miniatures, but they make sessions more fun! Did I recently order a Tiamat figure the size of a small cat? Yes. Do I have a problem? No shut up.</p>

					<ul><li><strong>Video Games</strong></li></ul>
						<p>Am I sensing a pattern here? Eh it's probably nothing. Anyways, I'm a big fan of a lot of types of games, though right now i've been making my way though the Souls Games. I die. A lot...</p>

						<p>Huh, almost like I'm a geek or something...Oh well! Big fan of anime, though I haven't had too much time to watch it lately. I'm one of those crazy people who was caught up with One Piece for a while, though the pacing has since forced me to read the manga instead.</p>
