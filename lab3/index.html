	<h1> Lab #3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
	<main id=TextBacking>
		<p> The aim of Lab #3 was to create a local file structure, which we did in class, and then add index.html files.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Creating the local file structure was fairly easy to understand as we did it in class with guidance, and creating an index.html file was easier than I thought it would be. Unfortunately I found working with the site.css file to be frustrating. My grasp of css has certainly slipped since the last time I used it, and I had to ask for help from a roomate to inplement a gif in the background like I wanted.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results of the index.html file are fairly obvious as they are staring you in the face, and the file structure looks like so:</p>
	</main>
		<div>
			<img src = img\file_structure.png>
			<h3>Index.html as it appears online</h3>
			<img src = img\Index.html.png>
			<h3>Index.html source code</h3>
			<img src = img\Index.html(ATOM).png>
			<h3>Lab 3 as it appears online</h3>
			<img src = img\Lab3_Index.png>
			<h3>Lab 3 Source code</h3>
			<img src = img\Lab3_Index(ATOM).png>
			<h3>Site CSS </h3>
			<img src = img\Site_CSS.png>
		</div>
